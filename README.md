# Multiplication Table Animations

This is the "finished" code associated with the Multiplication Tables blog post 
<a href="https://ckcollab.com/2019/10/28/sacred-geometry.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
Feel free to fork this and play with it on your own. While there are many improvements 
that could be made, I'll be leavingcode in the same state it existed at the time of 
publishing the post.
