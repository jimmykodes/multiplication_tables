# Multiplication Table Animations

This is the "finished" code associated with the Multiplication Tables blog post 
<a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to fork this and play with it on 
your own. While there are many improvements that could be made, I'll be leaving
code in the same state it existed at the time of publishing the post.
